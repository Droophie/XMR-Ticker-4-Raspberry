Booting From USB Device
=======================================================


IMPORTANT NOTES: THIS #PERMANENTLY# ENABLES BOOTING FROM A USB DEVICE. YOU WILL STILL BE ABLE TO BOOT FROM A MICROSD CARD AFTERWARDS, BUT MUST REMOVE ANY EXISTING MICROSD CARD TO BOOT TO A USB DEVICE INSTEAD.


1) Open the 'Terminal' app from the menu, or login with a remote terminal (SSH).


2) Run this command to open the config file: 

sudo nano /boot/config.txt


3) At the bottom of that file, add these lines:

# PERMANENTLY enable USB Device Booting (can be removed AFTER reboot)
program_usb_boot_mode=1


4) Hold down the Ctrl key and X key at the same time, choose Y, hit enter to save / exit editing the config.


5) Reboot the Pi:

sudo reboot


6) After reboot, run this to verify (output should be 3020000a):

vcgencmd otp_dump | grep 17


7) Flash the raspberry pi disk image onto the USB device you want to boot from (just like you would for a MicroSD card), plug it into a raspberry pi USB port, REMOVE the microsd card (it will STILL boot from it if you leave it plugged in), and reboot the pi:

sudo reboot


You now should be running from the USB disk.

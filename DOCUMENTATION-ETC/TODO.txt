Add a VERY TINY upgrade ! round icon in top left corner, with VERY TINY wording 'Upgrade' to the right next to it. Use my github API logic javascript from taoteh1221.github.io, and port my version check logic in the portfolio app to javascript (even checks bug release versions). ALSO ADD A CONFIG SETTING TO DISABLE SHOWING THIS UPGRADE ALERT, DEFAULT TO 'ON'.

Add Binance US / Bitmex webocket API support.

Add "pkill chromium" as either notes, or an option in the install script (to close the ticker after auto-startup).

Post on telegram, discord, Twitter, and Facebook whenever there is a new release of the app.

Add SFTP setup as optional in auto-install, AND mention SSH login too (since the screen on the device will be occupied by the ticker running).

Optional integration with upcoming REST API in DFD Cryptocoin Values, that prints out extra bottom row of data showing price / volume percent change for last day and last week for each market.

Create install / uninstall dialog for bash auto install

Add "pkill chromium" as either notes, or an option in the install script (to close the ticker after auto-startup).

Post on telegram, discord, Twitter, and Facebook whenever there is a new release of the app.

Add SFTP setup as optional in auto-install, AND mention SSH login too (since the screen on the device will be occupied by the ticker running).

Optional integration with upcoming REST API in DFD Cryptocoin Values, that prints out extra bottom row of data showing price / volume percent change for last day and last week for each market.

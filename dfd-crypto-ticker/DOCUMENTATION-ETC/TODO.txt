Post on telegram, discord, Twitter, and Facebook whenever there is a new release of the app.

When adding new exchanges to the ticker app, bake in the ability to run multiple different exchange tickers in slideshow mode (coinbase and kraken and binance all at the same time).

Add SFTP setup as optional in auto-install, AND mention SSH login too (since the screen on the device will be occupied by the ticker running).

Add Kraken / Binance US webocket API support.
